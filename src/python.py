          "text": "Absolutely, using the Korean BBQ sauce you already have is a great and convenient choice. To intensify the flavor using the existing sauce, you can apply it as a glaze during the final minutes of grilling to ensure it caramelizes nicely without burning. Here’s how to do it:\n\n### Instructions for Using Korean BBQ Sauce as a Glaze:\n1. **Preheat the Grill:**\n   - Prepare your grill for medium-high heat.\n\n2. **Grill the Chicken:**\n   - Start by grilling the chicken breasts that have been marinating in the Korean BBQ sauce. Grill them for about 5-6 minutes on each side.\n\n3. **Apply the Sauce as a Glaze:**\n   - In the last 3-4 minutes of grilling, brush additional Korean BBQ sauce generously onto the chicken. Flip the chicken and brush the other side as well. Repeat this a couple of times to build a rich, caramelized layer of sauce.\n\n4. **Final Grilling:**\n   - Allow the sauce to caramelize and get slightly charred edges for enhanced flavor. Ensure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (74°C).\n\n5. **Rest and Serve:**\n   - Once grilled to perfection, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. This helps retain the juices and flavors.\n\nBy applying the sauce towards the end, you avoid burning the sugars in the sauce while still achieving a beautifully glazed and flavorful finish. This method should give your Korean BBQ chicken a delicious boost in flavor. Enjoy your meal!"
